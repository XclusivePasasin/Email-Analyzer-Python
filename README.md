# Email-Analyzer-Python
The objective of this project is to develop an automated procedure to analyze email inboxes, identify and download attachments in .json and .pdf format, and perform subsequent analysis on these files. If no files with the specified extensions are found, the procedure is skipped.

## Installation

In order to install the project, we will create a .venv to install the dependencies

```bash
  pip install virtualenv

```
```bash
  virtualenv venv
  .\venv\Scripts\activate  
```
Once the .venv terminal is installed and running, install the dependencies by running

```bash
  pip install -r requirements.txt
```
To disable the virtual environment
```bash
  deactivate 
```
